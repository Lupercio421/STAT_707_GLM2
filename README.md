# STAT_707_GLM2

Hello everyone, for the Spring 2021 semester, I was enrolled in STAT 707-General Linear Models II. The professor gave students the option of coding the homework in Python or R. I decided to stick with R, so I can continue doing homeworks in the Tidyverse framework. The textbook referenced is "Applied Linear Statistical Models", 5th edition by Michael Kutner.
